Creating a packet sniffer tool involves using network programming libraries to capture and analyze packets. Here, we'll use Python and the scapy library, which is a powerful packet manipulation tool. Before we start, it's crucial to note that using such tools should always be done ethically and legally. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions to monitor and analyze network traffic.

Here's a basic example of a packet sniffer tool in Python using scapy:

Installation
First, make sure you have scapy installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:"pip install scapy"

How to Use
Replace "eth0" with your network interface. You can find your interface name by running ifconfig (on Linux/macOS) or ipconfig (on Windows).
Run the script with sudo or administrator privileges (sudo python3 sniffer.py or python3 sniffer.py).
It will start capturing packets and display relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols (TCP/UDP/Other), source, and destination ports, and payload data.
Important Notes
Ethical Use: Ensure you have permission to capture packets on the network you are monitoring. Unauthorized packet sniffing is illegal and unethical.
Privacy: Be cautious not to capture sensitive information such as passwords, personal data, or financial information.
Educational Purposes Only: This tool should only be used for learning, understanding network protocols, and security research in controlled environments.
Remember, this is a basic example. Depending on your requirements, you might want to add more features such as filtering, saving captured packets to a file, or more detailed packet analysis. Always continue learning and ensure ethical use of such tools.
